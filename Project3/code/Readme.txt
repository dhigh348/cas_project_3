Information: 
    To run the analysis and code to produce all graphs in the paper run all 
    cells in the jupyter notebook project_3.ipynb. This stores and retrieves 
    all necessary data from the data folder. 
    The figures are located in /data/figures and are produced with the jupyter
    notebook code. yfinance, numpy and pandas will need to be installed for 
    data analysis performed in the notebook. Stock data is not retrieved from 
    the data file but from an API call with yfinance.
